# FreightCalculator
// Shipping calculator

// Prompt user for:

//      - item name

//      - is fragile? + 2.00

//      - order total w/out shipping

//      - destination (USA, Canada, Australia, or Pluto. Some people say it isn't a planet anymore, but what do they know?)

//      - weight of shipment

//      - length of shipment

//      - width of shipment

//      - height of shipment

// We will calculate the freight density

//    freight density will determine the freight class

// We will use a multi-alternative if statement to determine shipping cost based on Order cost and country

// We will then print out the information to the console and write it to a file.
